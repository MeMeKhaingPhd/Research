        <!-- You can add a paragraph or two introducing yourself here -->
        I am currently pursuing her Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in computer science in the field of design, analysis and optimization of energy systems engineering and applying deep learning at International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore, India. I have completed my first and second degrees, as Bachelor of Computer Science and Bachelor of Computer Science (Hons:) respectively in 2009 and 2010. In 2011, I started Master degree and completed two years of Master degree in computer science in 2013. After completing Master degree, I worked as a faculty at Computer University (Myitkyina) Kachin State and currently, I am working as a faculty at Myanmar Institute of Information Technology (MIIT) Mandalay, Myanmar. Now, I have 10 yearsâ€™ experience in teaching and mentoring. As my professional achievements, I worked as a project staff at Vellore Institute of Technology, VIT Vellore in India under ASEAN fellowship scheme that I got through a selection process.
